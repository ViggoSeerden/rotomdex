# RotomDex

A WIP Pokédex application in development for iOS and Android made with Flutter, currently as a school project. 

Currently contains the most up-to-date (generation 9) info on the original 151 Pokémon, plus moves and abilities up to generation 8. Some inaccuracies are present.

## Summarized vision for final product:
- Accurate and up-to-date info on every Pokémon, move and ability, including alternate forms. (Possibly items, too).
- Scanning function: Being able to scan a Pokémon using your camera to get it's info.
- AR: Being able to see a life-sized 3D Pokémon model using your camera.
- Team Builder: Build teams and see their statistics, with the option to import/export from/to Pokémon Showdown.
- Who's That Pokémon: 5 rounds per day with leaderboards and point rewards with multipliers for consistent participation.
- Themes: A variety of themes, including ones inspired by official Pokémon media, being unlockable through the aforementioned points.
- Zero monitization or ads.
